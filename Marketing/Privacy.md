# Privacy

Access to your personal information will be kept with the utmost confidentiality until you give permission.  Organizers will have access to information they input into the system, until users opt to register for themselves, at which point, they will be asked to select what information will be made available to whom.

By registering as an organizer, you agree to share your first name and e-mail address with leaders and volunteers in your network.  Additionally e-mails may be generated with you as the `reply-to` address.  You also agree that invitations to join may be sent on your behalf when any of the following occur:

- You assign leaders to an action
- You send notifications or messages to your volunteers

Once organizers have imported contacts, leaders or volunteers may opt to no longer receive notifications from the platform which will include any direct messages you send.
